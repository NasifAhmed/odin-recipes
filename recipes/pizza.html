        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil </li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough </li>
            <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced </li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro </li>
            <li>½ cup ricotta cheese </li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly, then cut into strips.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter with garlic, onion and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate until set.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, and spread the herb butter over the surface using the back of a spoon. Arrange chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices, cilantro and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned and center is cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
